# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office

## Introduction
This project focuses on exploring movie durations on the streaming giant, Netflix, using the popular Python libraries, Pandas and Matplotlib. The project is centered around a CSV file containing Netflix movie data, which we will manipulate and visualize to answer questions about movie durations.

## Objectives
- Load and clean data from the Netflix movie dataset
- Perform data manipulations to answer questions about movie duration trends
- Create meaningful visualizations to communicate the results of our analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries using pip or conda
3. Run the `movie_duration_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
This project is a great opportunity for those looking to improve their Python data manipulation skills and get hands-on experience working with real-world data. Whether you are an aspiring data analyst or just a curious learner, this project is an excellent place to start.
